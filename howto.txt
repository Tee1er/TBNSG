Increasing your economic output:
================================

To increase your economic output, you must first either increase your territory, so you can grow more items, or you must increase what industries you have. 

INDUSTRY METHOD
Starting new industries will first require an investment from you. There will be a 20% chance after 365 game days, but if you don't want to wait 30m for that to happen, you may invest money into that industry to start it sooner. Some industries will require infrastructure to build up. Taxation is necessary to get money from your industries, but be aware that excessive taxation can reduce economic output, therefore defeating the purpose. Find a good tax rate that works for both your government and your citizens. Industries increase your economic output, also making it easier for you to win a war. Note that upgrading your infrastructure also makes your citizens happier, adding to the extra boost you get from starting up the industry, meaning that it's overall in your interest to start up more industries.
